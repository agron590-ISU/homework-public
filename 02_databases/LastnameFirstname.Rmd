A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away....

#### DATA WARS

Episode X  
Revenge of the RDBS, the SQL

It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although they have mapped the universe and stored it in a RELATIONAL DATABASE, the Empire has destroyed their only entity-relationship diagram.

A lone analyst works on the rebel base to restore balance to the force and remap the entities and relationships in the model while understanding the structures the designers intended. 

With only two weeks to complete his/her task, he/she queries the database to rediscover the mysteries of the universe...

#### Your mission

1. There is a database in the repo, `data/star_wars.db`. Recreate the missing entity-relationship diagram and include an image of it here. You can use any method you like to draw the ERD (by hand + scan, powerpoint, or https://www.draw.io/).
2. For each table in the database, what normalized form is it in (if any)? Give some reasoning behind your answers.
3. Use SQL to answer the following questions and submit your queries.
    a. What is the most highly populated planet documented in the universe?
    b. Which planet has the most named characters from the films? What species is native to this planet?
    c. Who has piloted the most spacecraft (vehicles and starships) in the universe (documented)? What about just vehicles?
    d. How many people have never piloted a spacecraft according to this data?
    e. How many spacecraft have no documented pilots? What are their names?
